# JimTech Solutions NextJS + Supabase Boilerplate

Welcome to the NextJS + Supabase Boilerplate, prepared by JimTech Solutions for accelerating the development of future SAAS projects. This boilerplate is built on top of Next.js and integrates Supabase for easy backend management. It aims to launch projects quickly, providing a robust foundation that combines the best of modern web technologies with efficient backend services.

## Getting Started

To kickstart your development server, execute one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

After running the command, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application. Begin editing the application by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. Your changes will reflect in real-time as you edit the file.

### API Routes

Access API routes at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). You can edit this endpoint in `pages/api/hello.ts`. The `pages/api` directory is specifically for API routes, which are automatically mapped to `/api/*`, distinguishing them from React page components.

### Font Optimization

This boilerplate leverages [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for optimizing and loading the Inter Google Font, ensuring your application loads quickly and efficiently.

## Learning Resources

To deepen your understanding of both Next.js and Supabase, the following resources are recommended:
